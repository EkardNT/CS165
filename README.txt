USAGE:
	The program takes one optional command line argument.
		- If no arguments provided, the random seed is set to the result of calling std::time().
		- If one integer argument is provided, the random seed is set to that value.
		- Non-integer arguments are rejected and the random seed is set to the result of calling std::time().

ALGORITHM/DATA STRUCTURE:
	We use a binary search tree to hold the indices of the k greatest elements. In addition to the standard root pointer, we also maintain a pointer to the least index. When the tree's size equals k, new elements are compared against the least element before being inserted, so that the tree only contains the k greatest elements.
	
	Once all indices have been inserted, we traverse the tree in reverse order, adding the indices at each node to the Best[] array.
	
	We also memoized our comparisons, so that no pair of elements are ever submitted to COMPARE() more than once.
	
TIME ANALYSIS:
	It is immediately apparent that our algorithm is at least O(n), because we insert each of the n indices into our binary search tree. Normally each insertion into the binary search tree would be an O(log n) comparison operation, however our binary search tree is restricted in size to no greater than k, so each insertion is an O(log k) operation. After all indices have been added to the binary search tree, we traverse the entire tree in reverse order to add the greatest k elements to the Best array. Thus, the asymptotic time complexity is O(n * log(k) + k).

TIMING FUNCTION:
	todo

SPACE ANALYSIS:
	Our solution requires Î˜(k) space, both for the output Best array and the binary search tree which may have at most k elements.
